# Utility Repo 

Utilities will be added here as i build them and consider them worthy to be open source



Gulp builds and other tools
* in the near future i intend to fix my builds, diversify them, add new tools

### Gulp

#### The ideea is to create diffrent gulp builds to use in needed scenarios

#### What builds i have for now is :
* Master Gulp - This is something i built long  ago needs fix and breakdown

* Light Gulp  - This build is a light functional build for small test projects
  - for now only this one works , and am making it work flawless 
  
** These builds have gone through some change and i will update it 
- the new ideea is to make them versatile and do more cool stuff than compile sass 
- the second new ideea is to make them so gulp beginners understand how they are build and how to build their own in the future
